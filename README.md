# FORCE11 Preserving Interactive Research Content Working Group

Sign up and obtain more information on the Force11 Working Group [Home Page](https://force11.org/group/preserving-executable-research-content-challenges-frameworks-and-best-practices/). The working group has a core governing group and is open to others who want to review materials, attend guest presentations or just follow along with progress. All core members are listed below.

Use the group [GitHub repository](https://github.com/force11/percwg) for documentation.

The group started in March 2025 and is planning to conclude by August/September 2026.

## Description
Research is often more than the text content, and can include both the software and computational environments to reproduce work. These can be shared by researchers as computational notebooks, however, scholarly communications infrastructure is currently poorly positioned to both display, interact with, and archive that content. The next-generation of executable research content in scientific publishing requires comprehensive strategies, guidelines, and frameworks to ensure long-term preservation of the scientific record.

This working group will cover and work towards:

1. An ecosystem scan of computational and interactive publishing practices with an assessment of the current challenges for preservation and archiving.
2. A framework for ensuring graceful degradation of interactive content and computational notebooks, for example, identifying functionality guarantees over time and associated tradeoffs.
3. Checklists for preservation and archiving of computational articles from the lens of: (1) authors when creating content; (2) systems for hosting and distributing (publishing infrastructure & indexing/discovery); (3) standards.
4. Case studies that model the space of possible archiving and preservation workflows.

During this process, the plans may be updated based on feedback from the activities.
